# billbot
I was inspired by https://miserbot.concurrencylabs.com/ but itâ€™s clear that we need. The idea is to create the same project with none of the big drawbacks. We want to be as close to miserbot as we can



Integration into aws, google cloud and azure instead of just AWS
We make it easy to run your own and Open Source
We provide a public free version that provides some public stats about how much billing it handles


Miserbot is a great project, but for a company like mine, we need at least google and amazon as well.
